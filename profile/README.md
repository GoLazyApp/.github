GoLazy is the first **decentralized commitment platform** that transforms personal discipline into social impact. Users stake USDC on their goals, and while they work towards success, their funds generate yield through Stellar's Blend Protocol — with all earnings donated to charity. **Win or lose, the world wins.**

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**73% of people abandon their goals within the first month.**  
Traditional commitment apps lack real consequences, making it easy to quit when motivation fades. Meanwhile, billions in idle capital could be generating impact while people work on self-improvement.

**GoLazy solves both problems simultaneously.**

## ⚡ How GoLazy Works

### 🎲 **The Commitment Engine**

1- SET YOUR GOAL 🎯
↓ "Learn Spanish in 30 days"

2- STAKE YOUR COMMITMENT 💰
↓ Lock 100 USDC as motivation

3- FUNDS WORK FOR GOOD 🌱
↓ Your USDC earns yield via Blend Protocol

4- PROVE YOUR PROGRESS 📈
↓ Daily check-ins, photo proof, milestone tracking

5-WIN-WIN RESOLUTION 🏆
↓ Success = You get funds back + Yield goes to charity
↓ Failure = Your stake becomes charitable donation

---

### 🔄 **Smart Contract Logic**
- **Time-locked escrow** holds your USDC during goal period  
- **Blend Protocol integration** generates passive yield on locked funds  
- **Automated resolution** based on goal completion verification  
- **Transparent charity distribution** with on-chain proof  

---

## 💡 Real-World Example

> **Maria's Goal**: "Exercise 5x/week for 4 weeks"  
> **Stake**: 200 USDC  
> **Duration**: 28 days  
> **Blend Yield**: ~4 USDC earned during period  
> 
> **Week 4 Result**: Maria completes 22/20 required workouts ✅  
> **Outcome**: Maria gets her 200 USDC back, 4 USDC goes to Clean Water NGO  
> **Impact**: Personal fitness achieved + 4 people get clean water for a month 🌍

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### **Blockchain Infrastructure**
```rust
// Core Soroban Smart Contract Functions
stake_on_goal(user, amount, goal_id, duration) → lock_funds()
verify_progress(goal_id, proof) → update_completion()
resolve_goal(goal_id) → distribute_funds() + donate_yield()
emergency_withdraw(goal_id) → penalty_to_charity()
```

### **Yield Generation Pipeline** 
```javascript
Locked USDC → Blend Protocol → Lending Pools → Yield Generation → Charity Distribution
```
